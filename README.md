# Potential ideas

App that saves your running times (5K, 10K, half+full marathons). The fitness app would allow users to record their competition race information and metadata and keep track of races they've participated in the past. Users can enter metadata about the races, including location, date, duration, and metadata about the race itself (course difficulty, course terrain, weather, etc.) User would have the ability to view their racing progress over time.
